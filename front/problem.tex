\label{chap:problem}

The Rust programming language is a new system language developed by Mozilla.
With the language being statically compiled and built on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and due to features like low level control and zero-cost abstractions, the language is a candidate for use in embedded systems.

Silicon Laboratories, with their EFM32 series of microcontrollers, focuses on energy efficiency and for the microcontrollers to function in power constrained environments.
Their tool suite includes energy monitoring tools to analyze energy consumption at the source code level. The series is based on the ARM Cortex M processor family.
With ARMs move towards using LLVM in their own toolchain, a back-end for the Cortex M series is already available.

The goal of the project is to explore programming for the EFM32 series of microprocessors in the Rust Programming language, and to evaluate performance and the energy consumption of the platform compared to the existing C/C++ code base.

The requirements of the projects are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify and describe the reqirements for an embedded platform for Rust
    \item Develop an embedded software platform for the Rust language on the EFM32 series
    \item Evaluate performance and energy consumption
\end{itemize}
