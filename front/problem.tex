\chapter{Project Description}
\label{chap:problem}

The Rust programming language is a new system language developed by Mozilla.
With the language being statically compiled and built on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and because of features like low-level control and zero-cost abstractions, the language is a candidate for use in bare-metal systems.

The EFM32 series of microcontrollers focuses on energy efficiency and for their ability to function in power constrained environments.
The tool suite by the vendor, Silicon Labs, includes energy monitoring tools to analyze energy consumption at the source code level.
The series is based on the ARM Cortex-M processor family.
With ARM's move towards using LLVM in their own toolchain, a back-end for the Cortex-M series is already available.

The goal of the project is to explore programming for the EFM32 series of microprocessors with the Rust Programming Language.
This should be realized by using as much of the features and tools available in the Rust ecosystem as deemed fit.
This whole platform should be evaluated and compared to the existing C platform provided by Silicon Labs.
