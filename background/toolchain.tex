\section{Build System}
\label{sec:back:build}

This section describes the build system.

\subsection{Compiler Toolchain}
\label{sec:back:build:toolchain}

Using an abstract view the compiler toolchain uses two major components.
The {\rustc} compiler, built on LLVM, and the \prog{arm-none-eabi} gcc toolchain.
C files for the emlib sources are compiled into object files using \armgcc.
\rust source files are compiled to object files with the \rust compiler.
Finally the object files are linked with \armld to produce an elf binary.
The \rust compiler does not support the target architecture directly, so a custom target specification is supplied.

\subsection{Cargo}
\label{sec:back:build:cargo}

\todo{Flesh out when cargo is used for building.}
