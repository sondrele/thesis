\subsection{Build System}

This section describes the build system.

\subsubsection{Compiler Toolchain}

Using an abstract view the compiler toolchain uses two major components.
The \textbf{rustc} compiler, built on LLVM, and the \textbf{arm-none-eabi} gcc toolchain.
C files for the emlib sources are compiled into object files using arm-none-eabi-gcc.
Rust source files are compiled to object files with the Rust compiler.
Finally the object files are linked with arm-none-eabi-ld to produce an elf binary.
The Rust compiler does not support the target architecture directly, so a custom target specification is supplied.

\subsubsection{Cargo}

\todo{Flesh out when cargo is used for building.}
