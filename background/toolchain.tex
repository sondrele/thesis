\subsection{Compiler Toolchain}

Using an abstract view the build system uses two major components.
The Rust compiler, built on LLVM, and the arm-none-eabi gcc toolchain.
C files for the emlib sources are compiled into object files using arm-none-eabi-gcc.
Rust source files are compiled to object files with the Rust compiler.
Finally the object files are linked with arm-none-eabi-ld to produce a elf binary.
The Rust compiler does not support the target architecture directly so a target specification is supplied.
