\section{Hardware}
\label{sec:back:hw}

This project targets the EFM32GG microcontroller by Silicon Labaratories.
The chip denoted by Gecko \footnote{The EFM32GG is by SiliconLabs called the Giant Gecko, while the EFM32G is called Gecko} in this report contains a ARM Cortex-M3 32-bit microprocessor.
For development and testing purposes SiliconLabs provides two hardware kits with the Gecko.
The simplest of the two are the Giant Gecko Starter Kit.
This board contains a few leds, buttons, sensors, a segment LCD display and an expansion header.
The more complex board is called the Giant Gecko Development Kit.
It features buttons, leds, a joystick, a touch TFT Display and prototyping board.

Table \ref{tab:hardware} summarizes the different hardware devices refered to throughout this thesis.
