\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

The section contains all the background information that was deemed necessary in order to understand the contents of the next chapters.
We start by presenting the hardware and microcontrollers and its software suite that we utilize in this project, before we move on to present the Rust programming language and its package manager.
We assume that the reader is fairly known with common programming languages like Java and C++, in order to understand some of the fundamental differences with memory management between these languages and Rust.
