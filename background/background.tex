\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

The section contains all the background information that was deemed necessary in order to understand the contents of the next chapters.
We start by presenting the {\rust} programming language and some of its more prominent features, as well as the most important goals of the language.
We assume that the reader is fairly known with common programming languages like \Java, \C, and \Cpp, in order to understand some of the fundamental differences with memory management between these languages and {\rust}.
After presenting {\rust}, we move on to the hardware and microcontrollers that we have used in this project, including their software suite called \emlib.
% Towards the end we present some of the district differences between executing software, bare-metal on a microcontroller, in contrast to relying on an operating systems.
