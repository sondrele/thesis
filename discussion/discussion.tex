\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This project has covered a lot of implementation involved with {\rust} and {\C} for the {\gecko}, as well as presenting the ecosystem for building and distributing packages written in {\rust}.
In this section, we look at how well the current state of {\rust} is suited for bare-metal development on embedded systems.
Additionally, we revisit the language challenges that was first identified in \autoref{sec:intro:assignment} and discuss how they were solved for the {\rg} platform.
In \autoref{sec:avoiding_mutable_aliases_to_hardware} we investigate if it is possible to apply {\rust}'s ownership-semantics directly to hardware to avoid mutable aliasing to peripherals.
Towards the end of this section we, we evaluate and discuss the results that were gathered as part of the {\tracker} and the {\cg} applications.
