\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This project has covered a lot of implementation involved with {\rust} and {\C} for the {\gecko}, as well as presenting the ecosystem for building and distributing packages written in {\rust}.
In this section, we discuss the results that were gathered as part of the {\tracker} and the {\cg} applications.
Additionally, we look at how well the current state of {\rust} is suited for bare-metal development on ARM microprocessors.
% In \autoref{sec:disc:project_evaluations} we discuss the results we gathered from the two implemented projects.
% In \autoref{sec:disc:rust_for_arm} we look back at the project, we discuss how well {\rust} is suited for a hardware platform that is not supported by default, and what it is like to use {\rust} in an embedded system without an operating system.
% In Y we move over to discuss how well we were able to utilize {\rust}'s ownership-system to help us with the problem of mutable aliasing, and we propose a couple of sulotions for how to acheive this.
% In XX we give an evaluation of the project, and what we are satisfied with and what we are un-satisfied with.
