\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This project has covered a lot of implementation-level details involved with applying {\rust} to a bare-metal system, as well as presenting the ecosystem for building and distributing packages written in {\rust}.
In this chapter, we look at how well the current state of {\rust} is suited for bare-metal development on embedded systems.
Additionally, we revisit the language challenges that was first identified in \autoref{sec:intro:assignment} and discuss how they were solved for the {\rg} platform.
In \autoref{sec:avoiding_mutable_aliases_to_hardware} we discuss our investigation of the possibility of applying {\rust}'s ownership-semantics directly to hardware to avoid mutable aliasing to the peripherals.
Towards the end of this chapter, we evaluate and discuss the results that were gathered as part of the {\tracker} and the {\cg} applications.
