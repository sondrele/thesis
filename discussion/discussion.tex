\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

This project have covered a lot of implementation involved with Rust and C for the Gecko, as well as presenting the ecosystem for building and distributing packages.
In X we look back at the project, we discuss how well Rust is suited for a hardware platform that is not supported by default, and what it is like to use Rust in an embedded system without an operating system.
In Y we move over to discuss how well we were able to utilize Rust's ownership-system to help us with the problem of mutable aliasing, and we propose a couple of sulotions for how to acheive this.
In Z we discuss the results we gathered from the two implemented projects.
In XX we give an evaluation of the project, and what we are satisfied with and what we are un-satisfied with.
