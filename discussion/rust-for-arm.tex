\section{Rust for ARM} % (fold)
\label{sec:rust_for_arm}

When we started this project we were already aware that there was a couple of available projects that were running Rust bare-metal on ARM MCUs.
We did, however, not know how easy to would be to get up and running with Rust on an ARM MCU.
It took less than a day to execute a Rust blink-demo with the EFM32 and a LED on the STK.
The documentation was sufficient for figuring out how to define non-std Rust programs, and projects like \texttt{armboot} helped us to build the projects for ARM.
