\corechapter{Startup}{startup}{%
The startup module handles the process of starting a {\rust} application on the \glsdesc{mcu}.
This involves supporting some basic requirements for the language and setting up some important initialization of the processor.
This module is a foundation for the {\rg} platform, but can be used in isolation to run a program on the \gls{mcu} without any dependencies.

\corechapter{Rust Embedded Library}{rel}{%
The \glsdesc{rel} module defines the subset of the standard {\rust} library which is applicable for embedded applications.
This module builds on the foundation laid out by the startup module and is used by the \lib{bindings} and \lib{Application Layer} modules of the {\rg} platform.

This chapter starts with presenting the parts of \gls{rcl} that needs to be configured in order for the library to work for a new platform.
We then move over to describe the standard {\rust} libraries that provides heap allocation and dynamically allocated structures.
At the end of this chapter we present the \gls{rel}.

\include{implementation/rust-embedded-library}


\corechapter{Binding Libraries}{bindings}{%
The \lib{bindings} module includes the peripheral libraries provided by the \gls{mcu} vendor Silicon Labs, and the architecture designer ARM.
In order to make use of these libraries in {\rust}, we developed binding libraries to expose the underlying {\C} implementation to the {\rust} language.

\corechapter{Build System}{build}{%
In this chapter we step out of the core software components of the {\rg} platform to present an external but highly important part of the {\rg} platform.
The {\cargo} package manager is an integral part of the {\rust} ecosystem and facilitates sharing code libraries with ease.
Throughout this chapter we look at how we evolved the build system over time and ultimately migrated the process over to {\cargo}.
}
\include{implementation/building}

\corechapter{Application Layer}{app}{%
In the \lib{Application Layer} module of the {\rg} platform we find the application level libraries and actual executable programs.
As part of this chapter we have included some experimental libraries developed to explore the language facilities of the {\rust} programming language in an embedded system.
We also look at two projects developed for providing a qualitative study of the platform.

All of the programs and libraries presented in this section builds upon the foundation provided by the lower levels of the {\rg} platform.
None of these components are mandatory when using the platform, and when writing an application using this platform that code itself is considered part of this layer.
The components in the following section represent example applications and possible future extentions to the base {\rg} platform as given by the previous sections.
