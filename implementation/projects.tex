\section{Projects}
\label{sec:impl:projects}

This section describes two applications that were developed as part of the evaluation process of the {\rg} platform.
The two applications have been implemented in both {\rust} and {\C}, and we have gathered results from energy measurements, code size, and execution performance for all of the applications.
We use these findings to try and give an evaluation of {\rust} for an embedded system.
The results are presented in \autoref{chap:results} and discussed in \autoref{chap:discussion}, respectively.
