The implemented build process ({\cbuild}) is, to our knowledge, the first ergonomic build process using the {\rust} standard package manager, {\cargo},  for embedded systems.
Other projects have resorted to custom Makefiles to handle the build process and dependencies.

In order to develop the build process ({\cbuild}), {\cargo} had to be modified.
This resulted in implementing and contributing the subcommand ({\crustc}) to the {\cargo} package manager.

Throughout the development phase of the project the high level abstractions of {\rust} was tested out in an embedded environment.
These experimentations resulted in the a few successful and promising patterns ({\cmethods}).

By porting a driver in one of Silicon Labs' software libraries from {\C} to {\rust}, a minor bug was found and reported with a suggested patch ({\cbugfix}) to fix the issue.

At last the results reported and discussed in this thesis provides an evaluation ({\ceval}) of the {\rust} platform in an embedded system.
