Introduction}

Rust's low level of abstraction makes it a suitable programming language for embedded systems, and
combined with it's guarantees about memory safety and absent of data races and other common errors
like stack- and buffer-overflows, it makes for interesting research as replacement to C as the only
viable programming language for embedded systems.
