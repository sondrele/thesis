\section{Embedded Systems}
\label{sec:embedded_systems}

Computers have been adapted for virtually every problem that exist in the modern society.
They range vastly in size, from large warehouse computers with thousands of processor cores, to normal desktop computers and modern cell phones, all the way down to the small processors which are found in watches or microwave ovens.
Even though they differ in size and performance they all have one thing in common; all computers have a \gls{cpu} and a main memory.

An embedded system usually consists of a small computer which is \emph{embedded} with a range of different hardware devices, together forming a complete functional system.
Such hardware devices can be anything from analog sensors, to small electrical engines.
Embedded systems play a vital role in many modern applications, and are


An embedded computer system is very different from what people normally think of when they think of ``computers''.
