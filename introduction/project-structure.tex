\section{Project Outline}
\label{sec:project-outline}

The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the {\rust} language used in an embedded computer system.
The work was divided into several phases each having its own primary goal and subgoals.
\autoref{tab:meth:phases} summarizes the phases with the primary goals annotated.

In addition to the main phases in the project, the build system has evolved continously.

The rest of this section describes each phase in more detail.

\subsubsection{Phase 1 - Initial Programmability}
The initial phase of the project defined two main activities.
Firstly the initial direction of the project along with major challenges was identified in a meeting with Silicon Labs w/Marius Grann√¶s and Mikael Berg.
Secondly the milestone of running the first {\rust} application on the {\gecko} was reached.

\paragraph{Major Challenges}
The major challenges identified in the initial meeting with Silicon Labs are given in \autoref{fig:meth:challenges}

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Volatile read and write
    \item Handling Interrupts
    \item Reading and Writing Hardware registers
    \item Statical object construction
    \item Heap allocation
    \item Error Handling without allocation
  \end{itemize}
  \caption{Major Challenges}
  \label{fig:meth:challenges}
\end{listing}

These challenges and their relation to the project are described in \autoref{} \todo{Write this section in discussion chapter.}

\subsubsection{Phase 2 - Library Support}

After the initial compilation process was in place, the bindings for the \lib{cmsis} and {\emlib} libraries were started.
In this phase the technical difficulities for creating the FFI bindings was in focus when selecting which part of the libraries to develop.
As described in \autoref{} \todo{Background section on emlib design} the libraries to bind to expose their interfaces either as static utility functions or object oriented-like interfaces.
\autoref{tab:meth:lib} describes the initial modules developed with a description of their interaface and rational for chosing to develop the module.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
      \hline
      Module/Library & Interface & Rational \\
      \hline
      \hline
      core/cmsis & Static Utility & Low level dependency needed for Interrupts \\
      rtc/emlib & Singleton Object Oriented & Simple example of the interface type \\
      timer/emlib & Object Oriented & Example of the interface type \\
      cmu/emlib & Object Oriented & Dependency for handling clocks in emlib \\
      gpio/emlib & Static Utility & Simple module to provide testablility \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Table of initial library modules}
  \label{tab:meth:lib}
\end{table}

In addition to the

\subsubsection{Phase 3 - Development}
\label{sec:projects}

The goal of the development phase was to get enough empirical data to evaluate the system in Phase 5.
Two complementary projects was specified given in \autoref{tab:meth:projects}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    & Name & Emphasis \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Project I & Sensor Tracker & Energy Efficiency \\
    \hline
    Project II & Classic Game & Performance \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Projects developed in development phase}
  \label{tab:meth:projects}
\end{table}

Both projects are implemented in both {\rust}, using the framework developed for this thesis, and {\C} using the libraries provided by Silicon Labs.

\paragraph{Project I - Sensor Tracker}
The Sensor Tracker application was chosen to measure the energy efficiency of the system.
The application tracks sensor data periodically from the sensors provided on the STK and the BIOMETRIC-EXP-EVB expansion board.
Sensor data is stored in RAM and can be extracted over UART.

A full specification of Project I is included in Appendix \autoref{app:project:i}.

\paragraph{Project II - Classic Game}
The Game project was developed to measure the performance of the complete system.
As a starting point for the project the game assignment for the course TDT4258 developed by Antonio Garcia Guirado was used.
The game is a interactive graphical application written for the DK.

A full specification of Project II is included in Appendix \autoref{app:project:ii}

\subsubsection{Phase 4 - Evaluating}
During the evaluating phase the develop platform was evaluated based on the following metrics in \autoref{lst:evaluation:criterias}.
The results of the evaluation is presented in \autoref{chap:results} along side with results obtained by considering the existing platform in {\C}.
\begin{listing}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Performance
  \item Code Size
  \item Energy Consumption
  \end{itemize}
  \caption{Metrics for evaluation of the platform}
  \label{lst:evaluation:criterias}
\end{listing}
This phase also included tuning the applications and libraries to minimize the bias in the results.
