\section{Project Outline}
\label{sec:project-outline}

In this section we break down the project into five phases.
\autoref{tab:meth:phases} presents each of the phases with their primary goals, the rest of this section describes each phase in more detail.
In addition to the main phases in the project, the build system has evolved continously.

\end{table}

\subsection{Phase 1 - Hello World}
The initial phase of the project defined two main activities.
Firstly, the direction of the project along with some major challenges was identified in a meeting with Marius Grann√¶s and Mikael Berg from Silicon Labs.
Secondly, the milestone of running the first {\rust} application on the \gls{mcu} was reached.

\subsection{Phase 2 - Platform Design}

After the initial compilation process was in place, the focus shifted towards developing the platform for writing larger applications.
Throughout this phase we developed the support libraries for the MCU, which are described in \autoref{sec:rel} and \autoref{sub:interfacing_with_emlib}.
Early in this phase, technical challenges guided the choice of which part of the platform to develop.
The platform evovled continouosly during the development phase.

\subsection{Phase 3 - Development}
\label{sec:projects}

The goal of the development phase was to create applications that would provide enough empirical data to evaluate the platform in phase 4.
The two complementary projects in \autoref{tab:meth:projects} were specified and implemented as part of this phase.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Emphasis} \\
    \hline
    Project I & Sensor Tracker & Energy Efficiency \\
    Project II & Classic Game & Performance \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Projects developed in development phase}
  \label{tab:meth:projects}
\end{table}

Both of the projects were implemented in {\rust}, using the platform developed for this thesis, and in {\C}, using the libraries provided by Silicon Labs.

\subsection{Phase 4 - Measurement}
During the measurement phase, the platform was evaluated based on the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance
  \item Energy Consumption
  \item Code Size
\end{itemize}

The results from the evaluation are presented and compared with the existing {\C} platform in \autoref{chap:results}.

\subsection{Phase 5 - Evaluation}


Throughout this phase we investigated the results that was gathered in the previous phase.
These results provided a basis for a discussion of the project as whole was conducted and is presented in \autoref{chap:discussion}.
In this dicussion we look at the viability of using {\rust} in an embedded system and present our thoughts and experiences obtained during the work for this thesis.
