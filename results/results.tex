\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

In this chapter we present the results after conduction measurements on applications written for the {\rg} platform.
We mainly focus on the Sensor Tracker and Circle Game applications, but include some smaller applications to look at concepts in isolation.
The three metric chosen for measurements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance
  \item Energy Consumption
  \item Code Size
\end{itemize}
These metrics are integral to embedded computing systems and are somewhat related to each other.
In the last section in this chapter we look how the heap allocation is performed in {\rust} and {\C}.
