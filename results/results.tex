\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

In this chapter, we present the results after conduction measurements of the applications written for the {\rg} platform.
We focus mainly on the Sensor Tracker and Circle Game applications but include some smaller applications to look at concepts in isolation.
The three metrics chosen for measurements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance
  \item Energy Consumption
  \item Code Size
\end{itemize}
These metrics are integral to embedded computing systems and are somewhat related to each other.
In the last section of this chapter, we look how the heap allocation is performed in {\rust} and {\C}.
